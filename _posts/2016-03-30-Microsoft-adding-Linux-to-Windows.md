Bash will arrive as part of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update this summer, but itâ€™ll be available to Windows Insiders before that. And looking ahead, Microsoft says it may bring other shells to Windows over time, too.

### "This is a genuine Ubuntu image on top of Windows with all the Linux tools that are used."

#### Microsoft also posted a very in-depth video covering Bash on Windows.

Microsoft is reaching out to Linux developers in a way that the company never has before. "The Bash shell is coming to Windows. Yes, the real Bash is coming to Windows," said Microsoft's Kevin Gallo on stage at today's Build 2016 keynote. The announcement received an uproarious applause from the crowd. The new functionality will be enabled as part of this summer's Anniversary Update to Windows 10.


"This is not a VM. This is not cross-compiled tools. This is native," he said. "We've partnered with Canonical to offer this great experience, which you'll be able to download right from the Windows Store." Third-party tools have enabled this sort of thing for years, but a direct partnership between Microsoft and Canonical should offer even more flexibility and convenience for developers who prefer using these binaries and tools.


More importantly, it represents Microsoft's refreshing stance on open-source development. This [blog post by Microsoft's Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopersCanRunBashShellAndUsermodeUbuntuLinuxBinariesOnWindows10.aspx)  offers a deeper explanation of the move.


VP Terry Myerson teased "more coming soon" in regards to other possibilities signaling a modernized and extremely open Windows 10. "This is brilliant for developers that use a diverse set of tools like me," he said.

### As a Windows developer i can say - keep developing on Windows 10!

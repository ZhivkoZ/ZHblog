**ZHblog** is powered by Github and wants to thank all the cool ppl out there for helping out.

The blog contains docs with commands for github, mongodb and hopefuly soon others. It will also contain some news about web development, and itâ€™s focused on helping new coming web developers and mostly myself, while learning new stuff I'll maybe upload them here to never forget what I'm doing, so the blog could be useful.

I made this blog with the jekyll framework which powered sites like the one on the obama campaing and more...

**ZHblog** is a blog powered by freedom and made by a person who lives in Harmanli, BG.
     
The blog contains docs with commands for github, mongodb and hopefuly soon others. It will also contain some news about web development, and it's focused on helping new coming web developers and mostly myself. 

I made this blog after seeing the jekyll technology and the hosting from github for it. 

The design of the site is superb and it's called Ramme and is made for jekyll websites.
